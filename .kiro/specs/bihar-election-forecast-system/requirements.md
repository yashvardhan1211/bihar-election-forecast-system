# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Bihar Election Forecast System is a comprehensive automated prediction platform that provides daily updated election forecasts using real-time data ingestion, advanced NLP processing, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system combines news sentiment analysis, polling data, Google Trends, and machine learning models to generate accurate constituency-level predictions with uncertainty quantification and interactive visualizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a political analyst, I want an automated daily data ingestion system, so that I can have fresh election-relevant data processed every morning without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily at 6 AM THEN it SHALL fetch news articles from NewsAPI and local sources for Bihar-related keywords
2. WHEN news ingestion occurs THEN the system SHALL retrieve polling data from multiple sources and aggregate them with proper weighting
3. WHEN daily updates run THEN the system SHALL collect Google Trends data for key political figures and election terms
4. WHEN data ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL save raw data with timestamps for audit trails
5. IF any data source fails THEN the system SHALL continue with available sources and log the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want advanced NLP processing of news content, so that I can extract meaningful sentiment and entity information that correlates with electoral outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN news articles are processed THEN the system SHALL analyze sentiment using transformer-based models with confidence scores
2. WHEN entity mapping occurs THEN the system SHALL identify political parties (NDA, INDI, others) mentioned in each article
3. WHEN constituency mapping runs THEN the system SHALL map articles to specific regions and constituencies using keyword matching
4. WHEN sentiment analysis completes THEN the system SHALL apply exponential decay weighting based on article age
5. WHEN NLP processing finishes THEN the system SHALL save enriched data with sentiment scores, party mentions, and geographic mappings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a forecasting system, I want incremental feature updates using exponential moving averages, so that I can incorporate new information while maintaining historical context and avoiding sudden prediction swings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new sentiment data arrives THEN the system SHALL update constituency features using exponential moving average with configurable alpha
2. WHEN poll data is updated THEN the system SHALL calculate weighted averages based on sample sizes and recency
3. WHEN feature updates occur THEN the system SHALL apply regional sentiment modifiers to constituency-level features
4. WHEN features are updated THEN the system SHALL clip values to reasonable bounds to prevent outliers
5. WHEN feature processing completes THEN the system SHALL save both latest features and timestamped backups

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prediction system, I want Monte Carlo simulations with calibrated probability models, so that I can provide robust uncertainty quantification and seat distribution forecasts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL run 5000+ Monte Carlo simulations using the trained model
2. WHEN simulations execute THEN the system SHALL use calibrated probabilities to ensure accurate uncertainty estimates
3. WHEN Monte Carlo runs complete THEN the system SHALL calculate percentile distributions (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th)
4. WHEN seat predictions are made THEN the system SHALL identify marginal seats with win probabilities between 0.3-0.7
5. WHEN simulation results are ready THEN the system SHALL classify seats as Safe/Lean/Toss-up for both alliances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a political stakeholder, I want an interactive real-time dashboard, so that I can visualize current forecasts, track trends over time, and download detailed analysis reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display current seat forecasts with key metrics (mean, median, majority probability)
2. WHEN users view distributions THEN the system SHALL show interactive seat distribution charts and percentile tables
3. WHEN users examine marginal seats THEN the dashboard SHALL display the top 20 most competitive constituencies with win probabilities
4. WHEN users check trends THEN the system SHALL show historical forecast evolution over the past 30 days
5. WHEN users need data THEN the dashboard SHALL provide CSV downloads for marginal seats and full text reports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated scheduling and error handling, so that I can ensure reliable daily operations with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scheduler starts THEN it SHALL run daily updates at the configured time (default 6 AM)
2. WHEN errors occur during pipeline execution THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with partial results
3. WHEN daily updates complete THEN the system SHALL archive results and clean up old data beyond 30 days
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide CLI commands for manual updates, scheduling, and dashboard launch
5. IF critical components fail THEN the system SHALL send appropriate error notifications and maintain system stability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want model persistence and incremental updates, so that I can maintain prediction accuracy as new data becomes available without full retraining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load the latest trained model from persistent storage
2. WHEN model updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support incremental learning or sliding window retraining
3. WHEN models are updated THEN the system SHALL recalibrate probabilities to maintain accuracy
4. WHEN model changes occur THEN the system SHALL save both latest models and timestamped backups
5. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL use the most recent calibrated model version

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and configurable system architecture, so that I can easily modify components, add new data sources, and adjust parameters without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL use centralized settings with environment variable support
2. WHEN new data sources are added THEN the system SHALL support pluggable ingestors without core changes
3. WHEN parameters need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of weights, decay rates, and update frequencies
4. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create necessary directory structures automatically
5. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces for loose coupling and testability
